switch

Limitations:
    data type


 Loops- statement that repetes itself  
 
 System.out.print("good morning")
 System.out.print("good morning")
 System.out.print("good morning")
 System.out.print("good morning")
 System.out.print("good morning")
 
 
 
 int time=11;
 
 if (time<12) {
 System.out.print("good morning");
 }
 
 while (time<12){
 System.out.println("good morning");
 }
 
 while loop syntax
 
 while(boolean condition)
 while vs do while--> both loops executed while condition is true
 
 while loop first CHECK condition-->if true->executes code do while frist EXECUTES code-->then checks condition
 
 for loop syntax
 
 for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
    
    code to repeated;
 }
  // Hello 5 times//
  for(int i=1; i<=5; i++){
   system.out.println("Hello");
   }
   
   when to use which loop:
   when we know on advance hoe many times to repeat block of code-> USE FOR LOOP
   
   when we do not know in advance how many times to repeat block of code-->USE While or Do While
