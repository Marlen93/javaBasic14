	 * what is type casting ?
	 * typing casting is converting one data type to another date type
	 * why should i learn about type casting?
	 * so we can use the code written by someone else to make life easier 
	 * or when we willing in teams able to merge the code
	 * what is syntax for type casting?
	 * when converting something smaller to larger we dont need to do anything
	 * it happens automatically we just assign the variable for example
	 * 
	 * int box=1234;
	 * 
	 * long box2=box;// this is how it works called implicit or widening automatically 
	 * 
	 * however when we convert a large data type tp a smaller date type 
	 * then this is how we do it
	 * 
	 * long box=1245454;
	 * 
	 * int box2=(int)box; narrowing or explicit or manual conversion
