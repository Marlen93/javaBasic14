Type Casting(primitive data types0:
type casting is converting 1 data time to another one.
for example we can covert a shot to a byte a long to float ect.
There are two main type implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/manual
implicit/widening/automatic Type casting:
when java converts the data type automatically for us. it only happens when we assign
 a smaller date type to a larger date type,Bc there is no data loss in this
 conversion.
 
 
 Explicit/narrowing/manual Type casting:
    when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called all of:
    Explicit/narrowing/Manual. it doesnt happen automatically we have to do it explicitly manually.
 why we should learn Type casting?
   when we write code in real life most of the time we use the code from others to save time
   and we might also need to covert data types to make our code compatible with their code.
 what is the syntax for type casting?
   we use () and inside the () we write the destination data type for ex:
   if we cant to convert a long to an int this is how we can do it.
   long var1=250:
    int var2=(int)var1;// its Explicit/narrowing/Manual
  double var3=var2 // Implicit/widening/automatic 
   float f=250.5f;
   double d=f;//Implicit/widening/automatic

 if Else conditions
   if else help us write code that can take the decision based on data. 
why we should learn about if else?
  Bc when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website our programs need to make a lot of decisions.
  If (the given username and password matches)
  (go to home page) ElSE (give user a warning)
 what is the syntax for IF ELSE condition 
  boolean isHungry=true;

  if(isHungry){ 
  System.out.println("Please Eat somthing")
  }else{
  System.out.print(" let buid some java program") 
  }
