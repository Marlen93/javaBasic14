* Type Casting:is converting the type of data from one data type to another one. we have 2 types of type casting.
 * 1) Explicit/narrowing/manual
 * 2)Implicit/widening/automatic
 * when we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called Explicit/narrowing/manual and when we go from a smaller data type to
 * a larger data type we call it Implicit/widening/automatic. * 
 * byte(8) smallest data type it goes up to 8
 * short(16) can only go up to 16    
 char (16) can go up to 16 but only on character can be entered 
 int (32) can go up to 32
 long(64) can go up to 64 
 float(32)can go up to 32 but always put F behind it when assigning 
 double (64) can go up to 64
 byte->short->char->int->long-float->double
 why we need type casting?
 when we are working in teams we might need to covert data from different date types . when we are workjing with math sometimes we need to 
 get rid of decimal part as we are only interested in the non-decimal part.
